# RTRP Wiki

Welcome!
This wiki page is for current or future student who are interested in Dr. Palmer's research group.
Our interests vary from accelerated transport methods, to core design, isotope production, and the use of advanced computational techniques to solve large scale problems.
We have provided some useful links to help current students (or just the casual passerby) find information on simulation tools available, thesis formatting, etc.
Along with this we have provided an interactive section (via Google Colab/Jypter Notebooks) for others to examine the work we have done to get a feel for our projects.
