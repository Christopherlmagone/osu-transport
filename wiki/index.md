# RTRP Wiki

Welcome!
This wiki page is for current or future student who are interested in Dr. Palmer's research group.
Our interests vary from accelerated transport methods, to core design, isotope production, and the use of advanced computational techniques to solve large scale problems.
We have provided some useful links to help current students (or just the casual passerby) find information on simulation tools available, thesis formatting, etc.
Along with this we have provided an interactive section (via Google Colab/Jypter Notebooks) for others to examine the work we have done to get a feel for our projects.

If you're interested in attending OSU, please feel free to visit our individual pages and see what we are working on.
You can also reach out to any of us and we would be more than happy to answer any questions about our work, funding, or general life at OSU.

# Useful References

Our old wiki page had some useful information, but mind you, it may be a bit out of date...

# Interactive Media

Our research group is in the process of transitioning much of our work to Jupyter notebooks, which will allow us to share our work here and allow others view what we have been up to.
New to Jupyter notebooks? 
Check out an introduction to Juypter Notebooks [HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ryanstwrt/osu-transport/blob/gh-pages/users/stewryan/juypter_intro.ipynb) (Note: This will take you to a Google Colab page)
