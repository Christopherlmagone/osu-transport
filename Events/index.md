# Community Outreach
October 16-20, 2017 - [Nuclear Science Week](http://www.nuclearscienceweek.org)

> "This is the time to invite a nuclear medicine physician or radiologist to speak to a school group, take a tour of a nuclear power generating station, and learn about the history of uranium mining. Much has been accomplished in the nearly 75 years that this science spans. And, people and the environment have gotten hurt at times as well. Acknowledging this is what Nuclear Science Week is about; talking about these things, asking and answering questions, sharing ideas."

The First Annual [Walk for T1D: For a world without type 1 diabetes](http://www2.jdrf.org/site/TR/TeamJDRF/OregonSWWashingtonChapter4532?pg=entry&fr_id=6480) on May 20th in Corvallis was a huge success and great community event!  The RTRP group was part of over 300 people and we all raised $79,413 to fund scientific research to treat, prevent and cure type 1 diabetes.

# Engineering Out Loud

* [Season 1: Episode 5](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu/episode-5-odds-ends)

  The Monte Carlo method conjures images of a suave gambler beating the house in Monaco. In reality, Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms that use randomness to solve problems. 

  In this episode we hear from [Todd Palmer](http://ne.oregonstate.edu/todd-s-palmer), professor of nuclear engineering, about his use of Monte Carlo simulations in nuclear fuel research. In addition, find out how [Haizhong Wang](http://cce.oregonstate.edu/wang), assistant professor in transportation engineering, is incorporating Monte Carlo to model tsunami evacuation routes in the Cascadia Subduction Zone.
