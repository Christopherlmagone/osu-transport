# Community Outreach

The First Annual [Walk for T1D: For a world without type 1 diabetes](http://www2.jdrf.org/site/TR/TeamJDRF/OregonSWWashingtonChapter4532?pg=entry&fr_id=6480) on May 20th in Corvallis was a huge success and great community event!  The RTRP group was part of over 300 people and we all raised $79,413 to fund scientific research to treat, prevent and cure type 1 diabetes.

# Engineering Out Loud

* [Season 4: Episode 3](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu/s4-e3-partners-nuclear-power)

  Is it possible to revolutionize nuclear power in the United States? Oregon State Nuclear Engineering Professor Jose Reyes cofounded NuScale Power to do just that. He's joined by fellow Oregon State Nuclear Engineering Professors Qiao Wu and [Todd Palmer](http://ne.oregonstate.edu/todd-s-palmer) to discuss NuScale's revolutionary design and its test facility here on campus.

* [Season 1: Episode 5](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu/episode-5-odds-ends)

  The Monte Carlo method conjures images of a suave gambler beating the house in Monaco. In reality, Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms that use randomness to solve problems. 

  In this episode we hear from [Todd Palmer](http://ne.oregonstate.edu/todd-s-palmer), professor of nuclear engineering, about his use of Monte Carlo simulations in nuclear fuel research. In addition, find out how [Haizhong Wang](http://cce.oregonstate.edu/wang), assistant professor in transportation engineering, is incorporating Monte Carlo to model tsunami evacuation routes in the Cascadia Subduction Zone.
