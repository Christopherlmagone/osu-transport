I am a first year graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. at Oregon State University under the direction of Todd Palmer. I received my B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A&M University in May of 2016. My previous work and research has been primarily related to the modeling of special purpose nuclear power systems. Additionally, I have contributed to the characterization of the pulsed radiation environment in the Fuel Ringed External Cavity at the Annular Core Research Reactor at Sandia National Laboratories.

## Research
I am currently in the preliminary stages of arranging research with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The research will involve time dependent thermal and structural evolution of targeted in-reactor fuel-breeder material.

## Work Experience
* ***Los Alamos National Laboratory***
  * **W-13: Advanced Engineering Analysis**, Mentor: Bradley Cox, *May - September 2016*
    * Performed experiments to compare computer models to active and passive dosimetry measurement data in the Fuel Ringed External Cavity (FREC-II) at the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) at Sandia National Laboratories in order to assist in preparation for the Depleted Uranium Strain and Temperature - Enhanced Response (DUSTER-II) test series

  * **NEN-5: Systems Design and Analysis**, Mentor: David Poston, *June - August 2015*
    * Researched and developed a reactor model for the Russian BUK/RES-5 liquid metal cooled fast reactor used in reconnaissance satellites during the Cold War era
    * Used MCNP to confirm reported fuel loading, total mass, uranium content as well as several reactor parameters such as control drum insertion worth

Above is an example of the Fuel Ringed External Cavity modeling performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The figure was generated using an FMESH tally in MCNP. The figure demonstrates the strongly anisotropic radiation field present - useful for directional heating and radiation induced strain experiments.
