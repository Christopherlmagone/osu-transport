I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at Oregon State University under the direction of Dr. Todd Palmer in the Radiation Transport and Reactor Physics (RTRP) research group. I received my B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A&M University in May, 2016.

My current research involves solving the radiative transport equation for phonons to predict thermal conductivity in ceramics. My previous work and research could be summarized as: neutronic modeling of small special purpose nuclear power systems, dosimetry activation predictions inside research reactors, and modeling and analysis of sodium fast reactor shielding experiments.

## Research
* Lithium Aluminate is a ceramic breeder material that is of interest in the fusion community. Lithium Aluminate drastically changes microstructure and porosity as a function of neutron irradiation. These parameters directly impact the thermal performance properties of the ceramic. Certainty in thermal performance parameters is necessary for accurate and reliable modeling. The current fuel performance tools used by PNNL do not agree well with experimental data.

* Due to phonon transport being the primary heat transport mechanism in ceramic materials, Oregon State University and PNNL have partnered to develop a higher-fidelity mechanistic model based on phonon transport to approximate the thermal conductivity tensor in irradiated Lithium Aluminate. This model will eventually depend on the material microstructure, vacancy densities, defects and various other parameters that highly impact heat transport at the macro to micro-scale.

* We have developed an arbitrarily higher-order finite element radiation transport solver compatible with curved surfaces utilizing MFEM. This transport solver employs the Self-Adjoint Angular Flux (SAAF) formulation of the radiative transport equation using the Discrete Ordinates (Sn) approximation.

  * **W-13: Advanced Engineering Analysis**, Mentor: Bradley Cox, *May - September 2016*
    * Assisted with pulsed neutron experiments to compare computer models in MCNP to active and passive radiation dosimetry measurement data in the Fuel Ringed External Cavity (FREC-II) at the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) at Sandia National Laboratories in order to assist in preparation for the Depleted Uranium Strain and Temperature - Enhanced Response (DUSTER-II) test series.

  * **NEN-5: Systems Design and Analysis**, Mentor: David Poston, *June - August 2015*
    * Researched and developed a reactor model in MCNP for the Soviet BUK/RES-5 liquid metal cooled fast reactor used in reconnaissance satellites during the Cold War era. Assembled reactor information from several unofficial reports, papers, and sketches. Confirmed unofficial approximate reported fuel loading, total mass, uranium content as well as several reactor parameters such as control drum insertion worth.
