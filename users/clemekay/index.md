## About Me

I'm currently a first year graduate student at Oregon State University under Dr. Todd Palmer. I work with the Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT), a PSAAP-III focused investigatory center led by OSU and partners Notre Dame University and North Carolina State University. The center's goal is to advance Monte Carlo neutron transport capabilities, and I work under the main thrust area of Predictive Science. More information for CEMeNT can be found [here](https://cement-psaap.github.io). My current research interests include time-dependent monte-carlo, dynamic-mode decomposition solutions, and parallel computing.  

I got my bachelor's degree in Nuclear Engineering with a minor in French and Francophone studies from the University of Florida in 2019. While at UF, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant under Dr. Sedat Goluoglu in reactor physics, processing the ENDF/B-VIII.0 evaluated cross section libraries using AMPX.

## Work Experience
* ***Idaho National Laboratory (INL)***
	* **Experiment Analysis Intern**, Mentors: John D. Bess & Nicolas Woolstenhulme, *January - June 2020*
		* Continued previous INl project optimizing critical configurations of INL's Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) by integrating upgrade fuel models into a standard TREAT model using MCNP. Parameters such as excess reactivity, power peaking factor, and power coupling factor were calculated to optimize placement of the upgrade fuel in the core. Critical models were made for various experiment configurations in TREAT.

	* **Reactor Physics Intern**, Mentor: John D. Bess, *June - Auggust 2019*
		* Modeled upgrade fuel in MCNP for TREAT using fabrication and technical specification documents for the upgrade's previous design work in the 1970s and '80s. The MCNP model of the upgrade fuel was then implemented in an existing model of TREAT's current design to find critical configurations and possible uses of the upgrade fuel.  

* ***Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)***
	* **National Nuclear Data Center Intern**, Mentor: Gustavo Nobre, *June - August 2018*
		* Wrote scripts to automate runs of EMPIRE, a nuclear reaction code, and analyze the generated data. Some of the data generated include reliable evaluated files across the whole nuclide chart, including nuclei off-stability. An adiabatic model previously developed by Nobre et. al was used to describe statically-deformed nuclei in the rare-earth region and applied to all isotopes of Gadolinium and Tungsten.
