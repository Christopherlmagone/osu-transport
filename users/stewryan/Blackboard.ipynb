        "\n",
        "*   Blackboard: Specialized space for agents to write their solutions to a problem too. This is typically stored in memory for quick access, but can also be written to a file for later use. The blackboard can contain specialized infrastructures which ease the reading and writing process for large problems.\n",
        "*   Controller Agent: Initiates the problem, tells other agents when to perform their actions, and when  their results can be added to the blackboard.\n",
        "*   Knowledge Agents: Contain specialized expertise in a problem and contribute to solving the problem at large with their specific piece of knowledge. For a multi-physics problem, this could be solving a set of equations with different methods or solving different sets of equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a basic blackboard system which involved three agents; a controller and two knowledge agents.\n",
        "The blackboard is used to create a HDF5 file, which the agents will write too, and keep track of the progress of the agents.\n",
        "The simple example has a controller and two agents (A and B) writing the square of values 0 to 9 to the database.\n",
        "Neither agent wants to copy what the other is dointn so they perform a simple check to ensure they are producing unique data. \n",
        "If so, they write the square of the given value to the database.\n",
        "Agent A is working in forward from 0 to 9, while Agent B is working in reverse. \n",
        "At the end, the database has 10 entries ranging from 0 to 9."
