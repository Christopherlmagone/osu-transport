Hello! I am a first year graduate student working in the Radiation Transport and Reactor Physics research group under the direction of Dr. Todd Palmer at Oregon State University. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Illinois in the spring of 2019. While completing my degree I worked in physics outreach via a physics-based escape room under the direction of Dr. Paul Kwiat. 

My personal interests include film, music, video games, college football, cooking, eating, and taking my dog on hikes.
