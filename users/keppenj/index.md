================================

Hello!

I am a junior in Nuclear Engineering at Oregon State University. I recently began work with Dr. Palmer on a Lead-Slowing Down Spectrometer (LSDS) that we hope to acquire from PNNL. 

I am also training to receive my reactor operator lisence in order to operate the Oregon State TRIGA Reactor (OSTR).

You can reach me at 541-892-3446, or email at keppenj@oregonstate.edu
