================================

Hello!

I am a second year Master's student at Oregon State Univeristy, where I previously received a Bachelors degree in nuclear engineering. I did my undergraduate thesis work with Dr. Palmer on a Lead-Slowing Down Spectrometer (LSDS) that we hoped to acquire from PNNL.

I am a licensed operator on the Oregon State TRIGA Reactor.

You can reach me at 541-892-3446, or email at keppenj@oregonstate.edu
