================================

Hello!

I am a second year Master's student at Oregon State University, where I have also received a Bachelors degree in nuclear engineering. I did my undergraduate thesis work with Dr. Palmer on modeling a Lead-Slowing Down Spectrometer (LSDS).

My Master's research is looking into the feasibility of a thermal spectrum thorium breeder reactor that can operate at steady state without chemical reprocessing or additional enriched fuel.

I am a licensed operator on the Oregon State TRIGA Reactor.

You can reach me at 541-892-3446, or email at keppenj@oregonstate.edu
