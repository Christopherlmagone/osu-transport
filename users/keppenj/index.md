Hello!

I am a second year Master's student at Oregon State University, studying nuclear engineering under Dr. Camille Palmer and Dr. Todd Palmer. I received my bachelors degree in nuclear engineering from Oregon State in 2018. I currently work at NuScale Power as an engineering intern in the Office of Technology. I am also a licensed operator on the Oregon State TRIGA Reactor. I interned at Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in the Nuclear Analysis department in 2016, and began working at NuScale as an intern in the Regulatory Affairs department in 2017.

## Research

My Master's research is focused on the feasibility of a thermal spectrum thorium breeder reactor that can operate at steady state without chemical reprocessing or additional fissile fuel. A large portion of the work for it has been coupling the neutronics and depletion code suite, SCALE, to a black-box optimization code called Gnowee.

 ### Research Interests

 - Breeder-Burner Reactor Design
 - Design Optimization
 - Heat Pipe Cooling

### Conferences
- ANS Student Conference, Gainsville, FL, March 2018.

## Personal Interests

- Physical fitness (running, weightlifting)
- Homebrewing mead
- Tabletop role-playing games with friends
