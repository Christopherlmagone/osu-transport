I am a 4th year graduate student here at OSU in Corvallis, OR working under the guidance of Todd Palmer. I began graduate school in January of 2014 and have since been a full time student collaborating on research with [Idaho National Laboratory](https://www.inl.gov/) (INL). I interned at INL in the summer of 2015 and 2016. There I worked with the [Rattlesnake/MAMMOTH Reactor Physics and Analysis group](https://moose.inl.gov/mammoth/SitePages/Home.aspx), specifically under the guidance of Javier Ortensi. I defended my Masters of Science degree in October of 2015 in nuclear reactor analysis and published my thesis (see publications below) shortly thereafter.

Since then, I have been pursuing my Doctoral degree in *a priori* parametric model reduction. High fidelity (i.e. aiming for high accuracy) simulations in nuclear reactor physics inherently lie in high-parameter spaces and commonly suffer from what is known as the "curse of dimensionality". In spite of the many advances in mathematics and computer science, many of these problems are even too costly for the largest supercomputers at our national labs.

Due to the combination of high parametric space and [increasing need for high-fidelity calculations](https://energy.gov/ne/nuclear-reactor-technologies/advanced-modeling-simulation), there has been a developing interest in applications of contemporary reduced order modeling methods. Unfortunately, as one can imagine, obtaining high quality experimental or simulation data for a nuclear reactor can be difficult and costly; thus making the use of more developed data-driven methods (such as proper orthogonal decomposition or active subspaces) infeasible.

Rather, my work focuses on adapting what is known as the _proper generalized decomposition_ for transient neutron diffusion. Rather than get into the details here, you can find a short, three page abstract of this work [here](./files/Alberti_ICTT2017_Abstract.pdf). If you are interested in my work or just have general questions about nuclear related things, please contact me!

### Other Interests
Rock climbing, frontcountry and backcountry camping, hiking, grilling, off roading, and general outdoors adventures.  Music. Lots of music.  I'm a beginner in woodworking and enjoy doing minor auto repairs on my '99 Toyota 4Runner. I also enjoy casual sport shooting. Traveling and just generally exploring new places is also something I genuinely enjoy doing.
