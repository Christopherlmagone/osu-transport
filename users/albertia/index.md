change here.

I am a 3rd year graduate student here at OSU in Corvallis, OR working under the guidance of Todd Palmer. I began graduate school in January of 2014 and have been a full time student since. I defended my Masters of Science degree in October of 2015 and published by Masters thesis (see publications below) shortly thereafter.

Since then, I have been pursuing my Doctoral degree in further developing depletion methods for MAMMOTH - the reactor physics subpackage of the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment, otherwise known as MOOSE.  In particular, I am focusing on reducing the order of the depletion calculations in order to observe an effective speedup in depletion calculations.

I have interned at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in Idaho Falls, ID in the summer of 2015 and 2016. At INL I worked with the Rattlesnake/MAMMOTH Reactor Physics and Analysis group, specifically under the guidance of Javier Ortensi.

### Research Interests
1. Reactor analysis and methods
2. Reduced order modeling
3. Nuclear fuels analysis
4. Optimization techniques

### Current Projects
1. Automatic Generation of Simplified Depletion Libraries via Model Reduction
2. This website! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

### Select Publications and Presentations
1. A. Alberti. “Steady State Modeling of the Minimum Critical Core of the Transient Reactor Test Facility”, Masters of Science Thesis, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, October 2015.
2. A. Alberti, T. Palmer, J. Ortensi, and M. DeHart, Calculation of the TREAT Minimum Critical Core Using MAMMOTH and SERPENT. PHYSOR, Sun Valley, Idaho 2016, American Nuclear Society, 2016.

### Conference Attendance
1. Intention of submitting to M&C 2017 (presenter and attendee).
2. Intention of attending ANS Winter Conference in Las Vegas, NV (technical assisstant)
3. PHYSOR 2016 at Sun Valley, ID (presenter and attendee).

### Other Interests
Rock climbing, frontcountry and backcountry camping, hiking, grilling, off roading, and general outdoors adventures.  Music. Lots of music.  I'm a beginner in woodworking and enjoy doing minor auto repairs on my '99 4Runner. I also enjoy casual sport shooting. Traveling and just generally exploring new places is also something I genuinely enjoy doing.
