I am a junior majoring in Nuclear Engineering at Oregon State University. I am interested in computational tools for examining advanced reactors of all kinds. My current research involves examining molten salt reactors using the code Moltres, which is based off of the MOOSE framework. I have experience with a wide variety of nuclear based coding tools including MCNP, SERPENT, RELAP5, MOOSE and SCALE. 
I have previously worked as an intern at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and am always interested in hearing new project ideas.
