I am in my fourth year as a PhD student at Oregon State University. My advisors are Todd Palmer and Alex Greaney[^1]; I am also a member of the <a href="http://alexgreaney.com/" target ="blank">Computational Materials Group</a> at UC Riverside. I am currently installed at Idaho National Laboratory as an intern in the Reactor Physics and Analysis group.

## Research areas
We are interested in simulating deterministic phonon transport by further developing the code Rattlesnake (written in the <a href="http://mooseframework.org/" target="blank">MOOSE</a> framework) to predict thermal conductivity in nuclear fuels operating at high temperatures with isotopic defects and evolving microstructures. We are developing a framework to bridge the gap between the atomistic and engineering scale, and collaborate with <a href="http://www.engr.ucr.edu/faculty/me/AlexanderGreaney.html" target="blank">Dr. Alex Greaney</a> and his research group at UC Riverside. We have shown Rattlesnake to be an effective and efficient engine for simulating heterogeneous and homogeneous phonon transport; it solves the frequency independent equation of phonon radiative transfer in the self-adjoint angular flux formulation (SAAF) using the single mode relaxation time approximation. We are interested in phonon transport at high temperatures and therefore must implement multifrequency transport to model these physics effectively, in addition to considering contributions from anharmonic three- and four-phonon processes.


#### Thermal boundary resistance
Phonons crossing a material interface experience a phenomenon known as *thermal boundary resistance* (TBR), unlike neutrons which rely on a cross section of interaction to dictate their scattering behavior in materials. TBR occurs when phonons cross an interface; phonons are either transmitted or reflected based on probabilities which are dependent on internal energy, phonon velocity and density of states. We apply the diffuse mismatch model (DMM) to quantify the behavior of phonons at interfaces, which generates probabilities of transmission or reflection through that interface. We have implemented this method for 3D heterogeneous structures with quantized defects. These physics are necessary to include due to the highly mismatched interfaces (such as an interface between a xenon bubble and a surrounding UO$$_{2}$$ lattice).


#### Spectral phonon transport
We have demonstrated grey phonon transport in heterogeneous and homogeneous materials by implementing Boltzmann phonon transport framework into the radiation transport solver Rattlesnake, and can rapidly simulate phenomena in these cases to generate results which are consistent with those in the open literature. However, to fully capture the detail in the phonon spectrum (which can be obtained by performing *ab initio* density functional theory (DFT) simulations) we must simulate spectral phonon transport. Previous efforts to simulate spectral transport effects have not well-considered the tight coupling effects between discrete phonon groups. The method we have developed couples each discrete group to a global average temperature, and we have
derived a new term for the Boltzmann phonon transport equation which accounts for non-equilibrium effects, and conserves the heat flux. We can efficiently simulate and predict thermal conductivity, heat flux, and temperature distributions in dielectrics over a wide geometric range using the full dispersion relation and density of states.


#### Convergence acceleration methods
We found from our spectral transport work that convergence of phonon transport simulations can be unacceptably slow in large spatial domains which are acoustically thick (Knudsen number $$ < 10^{-2}$$). We are currently developing convergence acceleration techniques which leverage proven methods of conv ergence acceleration developed by the neutron and radiation transport
communities. In the acceleration, we perform both high-order (HO) and low-order (LO) simulations, and develop a term which makes the solutions of both the HO and LO systems consistent upon convergence. We anticipate this capability will be finalized before the end of 2019.
