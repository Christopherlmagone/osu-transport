================================

I am a first year Master's student here at Oregon State University.  I received my Bachelor of Science degree here as well.  I became a nuclear engineer in order to fulfill my dream of seeing a world powered by nuclear energy.

I work under Todd Palmer, and I am currently working on a project to help develop safeguards for small modular reactors.
